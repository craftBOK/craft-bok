## Take your action

### For novices and beginners:

Reach out to someone with experience in Pair Programming and ask them to pair with you.
If you do not find such a person in your company, go to a meetup or a code retreat.
When you feel confident convince your co-workers by trying it on your daily basis.
Remember to switch pairs regularly.

### For competent and experienced:

Try out different variants and constraints of Pair Programming (like Blind Pair or Silent Pair).
Look for someone new to Pair Programming, may be at your work place or at a community meetup and pair with them.
If you feel to need new inspirations try out Mob Programming.
