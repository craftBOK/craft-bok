# Pair Programming


Origin: Practice of [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org) 

Pair programming is a practice of extreme programming (XP) and helps developers to work together at a task using one computer.
The two persons have distinct roles to ensure both are engaged in the task at hand.
The roles are driver and navigator. The driver has the keeyboard and writes the code while the navigator tries to guide the driver and gives tips about refactorings, scope, design etc.
The driver should explain what they are doing, so that the navigator has a chance to help and give feedback about the current situation of the code.
In that way you can receive feedback about your code faster than in a code review or pull request.
Two people know about the code change and feature, this helps to share knowledge of the code base.
Over time it can be exhausting to pair program, so keep in mind to take regular breaks.

## Requirements

### Behavior
* be respectful
* dont talk down
* hear your pair out
* dont use smartphone during sessions
* take breaks

### Setup

You will need one computer and a area which is a good fit so that two people can work together over longer period of time.
Usually a table wide enough for two chairs.
It is a good choice if you have two screens mirrored, so that everyone can see the work comfortable.

## Take your action

### For novices and beginners:

Reach out to someone with experience in Pair Programming and ask them to pair with you.
If you do not find such a person in your company, go to a meetup or a code retreat.
When you feel confident convince your co-workers by trying it on your daily basis.
For inspiration for a safe non production task see a [collection](http://kata-log.rocks/pair-programming.html).
Remember to switch pairs regularly.

### For competent and experienced:

Try out different variants and constraints of Pair Programming (like Blind Pair or Silent Pair).
Look for someone new to Pair Programming, may be at your work place or at a community meetup and pair with them.
If you feel to need new inspirations try out Mob Programming.
