# SOLID

Solid is a mnemnomic acronym of five software development princliples that are mainly used in OOP:

 - Single Responsibility Principle
 - [Open / Closed Principle](open_closed_principle.md)
 - Liskov Substitution Principle
 - Interface segregation Principle
 - Dependency Inversion Principle

The five principles were among others introduced in the paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns" by Robert C. Martin [[1]].
The acronym SOLID was established later, as it was discovered by Michael Feathers.
