# Kata Workshop

This is rough guide for things you should think about if you run a kata workshop.

A recommended length of a kata workshop session would be 45 minutes coding with 10 minutes discussion and a 5 minute break.

If you want to do [pair programming](pair_programming.md) please keep in mind that the tables are wide enough for two chairs.
Setup tables in islands of maybe 4 - 8 persons and keep enough space between them that you are able to walk around and can help the attendees.
Have power plugs ready for the attendees laptops.
Have a space where the group can stand in a circle for retrospective.

Have snacks and drinks ready especially if the workshop is longer than 2 hours.
