# Contributing to the BOK

For the moment there is no structured approach, or any guidelines.
Right now we just document, what happened in our discussions.

Meanwhile, we very much want this to be a community effort, and operate in the open.

Please use Pull Requests to contribute.

In terms of ethical guidelines, let me sum this up as: Don't behave like an ass.
