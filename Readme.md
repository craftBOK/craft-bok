# (Software?) Craft Body of Knowledge (BOK)

## Meta

This repository captures the current state of affairs of discussing a "community curated curriculum" for elevating developer skills to a higher level in average.

It's supposed to be a living document, with many potential actionables, some of which might depend on you (yes, that's you. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details).

## (Possible) problem descriptions

Even (close to) 20 years after the wake of XP (Extreme Programming) and the Agile Manifesto, software developers world wide seem to be struggling with even basic principles and practices of modern software engineering.
There might be many reasons, and we don't claim to have an extensive answer.

## (Possible) solution

We started this journey based on the idea of a community curated curriculum.
Based on our experience as software professionals, we recognize a need of an opinionated framework for learning, referencing and advancing principles, practices and values of modern software development.
We can envision a number of approaches for doing so, and want to use this space to advance the effort.
